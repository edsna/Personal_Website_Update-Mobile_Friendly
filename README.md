# Personal_Website_Update-Mobile_Friendly
This project reflects an update to my personal website/portfolio.
It uses bootstrap to incorporate features that turn the web application into a mobile frindly version of the web application.
It can now adjust every page to any screen size on its own in a matter of seconds
